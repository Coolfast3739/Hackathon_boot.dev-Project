# Backend Application

## Overview
This is a backend application built with TypeScript. It serves as the server-side component for a web application, handling requests and responses, and providing the necessary APIs for the frontend.

## Project Structure
```

├── src
│   ├── server.ts          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── controllers        # Contains controllers for handling requests
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── routes             # Defines application routes
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── types              # Type definitions used throughout the application
│       └── index.ts
├── package.json           # NPM package configuration
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile TypeScript**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- The server listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controller methods.
- You can define additional routes and controllers as needed by following the existing structure.
- Ensure to update the TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts` for any new request or response formats.
